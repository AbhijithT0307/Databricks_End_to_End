## 🛠️ Key Components

### 🔹 Data Ingestion
- Load raw data from external sources (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3 or Azure Data Lake).
- Support for batch and streaming ingestion scenarios.

### 🔹 Data Transformation
- Clean and transform data using PySpark DataFrames.
- Create bronze, silver, and gold tables following medallion architecture best practices.

### 🔹 Analytics & Reporting
- Perform advanced aggregations and business metrics calculations.
- Build visualizations and reports using Databricks SQL and built-in dashboards.

### 🔹 Machine Learning Modeling
- Train predictive models on processed data using MLflow for experiment tracking.
- Deploy models for batch or real-time inference.

- `customer_id`
- `product_id`
- `transaction_date`
- `sales_amount`
- `region`
- `category`
- `discount`
